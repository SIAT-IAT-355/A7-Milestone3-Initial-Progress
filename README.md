# Assignment: Final Project Milestone 2 - Prototyping & Initial Progress

**Due Date:** November 17th, 11:55 PM

## Objective

This milestone focuses on the **initial progress** for developing your final project visualizations and integrating them into your website. You will establish the basic framework of your website and develop preliminary versions of your visualizations.

This is the second milestone, and future steps will involve continued development and refinement of your work.

## Instructions

### 1. Establish Your Website Structure

This milestone focuses on planning the structure and layout of your visualizations on your project website.

#### 1. Create a Website Layout in Figma

- Design a website layout using **Figma** (or any preferred design tool) that shows where each visualization will be placed.
- Explain why each visualization is positioned in its respective location, considering factors such as readability, user flow, and interaction.

#### 2. Plan Tools and Roles

- Identify any specific tools or libraries (e.g., D3.js, Vega-Lite) needed to create the visualizations or interactive elements.
- If working in a group, assign roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth collaboration.

#### 3. Basic HTML and Styling  
  Start applying basic CSS to ensure a clean, readable structure. Focus on layout and navigation elements.
  For responsive websites, and in general, you can use frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make using CSS easier (but you will have to learn those frameworks).


### 2. Develop Preliminary Visualizations

#### 1. Create Initial Visualizations:  
  Use tools like **D3.js**, **Vega-Lite**, or another library to create working prototypes of your visualizations.
- Ensure basic functionality is in place for each visualization.  
- Avoid over-focusing on advanced styling or interactivity at this stage.  

#### 2. Integrate Visualizations into the Website:  
- Embed your visualizations into the website and ensure they are accessible from the relevant sections.

### 3. Reflect on Challenges and Progress

#### 1. Identify Challenges:  
  Document any difficulties encountered during this phase, such as coding issues, data inconsistencies, or tool limitations.  

### 2. Reflect on Progress:  
  Provide a brief summary of what you have accomplished so far, including what remains to be done.

## Submission Instructions

1. **Submit a PDF** containing:
   - Screenshots of your website framework, including placeholders for visualizations.  
   - Screenshots of the initial visualizations you have created.  
   - A brief reflection on challenges and progress.  

2. **Submit Your Website Link**:  
   - Include a link to your personal website where your project is being developed.  

3. Ensure your file is named as follows:  
   **Milestone2_Initial_FirstNameLastName.pdf**

## Some Tips

- **Focus on Foundations**: Prioritize getting the structure and basic functionality in place before refining design.  
- **Stay on Schedule**: Ensure you leave enough time for future steps of Milestone 3.  
- **Collaborate**: If working in a group, assign tasks effectively and communicate regularly.
